# What is a String?

In JavaScript, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in either single or double quotes. They are used to represent text data.

## Initializing Strings in different ways

### Single or double quotes

```js
const message1 = "This is a message with single quotes.";
const message2 = "This is a message with double quotes.";

// -- template literals
const name = "John";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### Template literals

```js
const name = "John";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### String Constructor

```js
const message = new String("This is a message.");
```
